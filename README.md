# Hackathon (DAVIGATE)
Datto Hackathon

During my summer internship @ Datto.Inc, Datto organized an engineering internship hackthon. 
We had 24 hours to develop a project under the theme Advancing Datto or Datto's Culture.
My team of 3, Lexington Johnson, Uche Unaegbu, & Marcedes-Antoniya Preston created a product called Davigate
An interactive webpage with an engaging in browser game. 
The purpose of the project was to centralize information needed to perform daily task due to training being limited!
